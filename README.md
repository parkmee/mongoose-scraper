# Mongoose Scraper
This NodeJS app utilizes scraping tools to mine and store articles from a [news website](https://www.huffingtonpost.com). Users may choose to delete or bookmark (save) articles, and search findings will persist in the database between use. The app is configured to only return unique articles and will not download articles that have been previously been scraped and deleted.
